  <h1>Nomad Angler</h1>
  <p>Nomad Angler is a travel and fishing channel about life on the road, wild waters, and simple moments in nature.

Here you’ll find fishing adventures in remote and lesser-known places, slow travel stories, and peaceful bushcraft-style videos. I explore rivers, lakes, and coastlines, chasing the bite while moving from place to place — sometimes far off the map.

This channel is not only about catching fish.
It’s about the journey, the silence of nature, and being present in the moment.

On Nomad Angler, you’ll see:

🎣 Fishing trips on rivers, lakes, and wild waters

🌍 Travel videos about unique places and natural landmarks (Baikal, Altai, and beyond)

🔥 Bushcraft & ASMR-style cooking — meat and fish over an open fire

🏕️ Camp life, outdoor skills, and simple living in nature

🚗 Roads, landscapes, and slow, honest travel

Just real travel, real fishing, and real nature.</p>
